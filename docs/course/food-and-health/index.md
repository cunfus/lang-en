## My commitment

I'm beginning my learning in Stanford Introduction to Food and Health

I know learning can be hard, but I have the patience, determination, and discipline to reach my goals.


When I'm stuck, I'll find a solution, like…


- Take a breath
- Break it down
- Ask for help
- Research
- Stay positive
- Talk through it
